### ðŸ”§ About the Framework

This framework is compiled from [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) TAG: 1.0.20-RELEASE.

Due to time constraints, we were unable to implement a highly reliable version of the transaction signing logic. Therefore, for now, the project relies on the C-based libsodium as a dependency for [JupSwift](https://github.com/jauyou/JupSwift).

To mitigate the risk of using third-party precompiled libraries that might contain backdoors designed to steal private keys, we compiled our own version: Clibsodium.xcframework.

For developers who prioritize security, it is strongly recommended to build your own copy by following the steps provided in this repository.
We also recommend using either the latest stable release or the most recent official release of libsodium.

If you prefer to build and package it yourself, follow these steps:

---

### ðŸ›  Build from Source

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
cd libsodium
```

#### 2. Compilation
```bash
./configure
make && make check
sudo make install
```

#### 3. Build for Apple platforms

Follow the official guide to cross-compile for Apple devices:
ðŸ‘‰ https://doc.libsodium.org/installation#cross-compiling-to-apple-devices

You can run the prebuilt script:
```bash
./dist-build/apple-xcframework.sh
```

#### 4. Replace the Framework in Your Project
Once the .xcframework is built, replace the existing one in your project with the new version:
```bash
# Replace the existing xcframework in your project
cp -R libsodium.xcframework /path/to/your/project/Frameworks/libsodium.xcframework
```
